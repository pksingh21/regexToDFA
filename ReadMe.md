# Regular Expression to Automata Converter

This is a Python script that implements Thompson's construction algorithm to convert regular expressions to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and then further convert NFAs to deterministic finite automata (DFA). The script also includes functions to visualize the NFAs and DFAs using the Graphviz library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Graphviz (Make sure to install Graphviz and add it to your system's PATH for graph visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ```bash
   python RegexToNFA20CS01003.py
    ```
    Enter the regex type you want
    Press Enter and the respective images in png format will be generated sample images and sample regex in code itself
